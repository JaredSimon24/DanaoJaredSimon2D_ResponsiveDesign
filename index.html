	 	<p>Our environment is constantly changing. There is no denying that fact. However, as our environment changes, so does the need to become increasingly aware of the problems that surround it. With a massive influx of natural disasters, warming and cooling periods, different types of weather patterns and much more, people need to be aware of what types of environmental problems our planet is facing.</p><p>Global warming has become an undisputed fact about our current livelihoods; our planet is warming up and we are definitely part of the problem. However, this isn’t the only environmental problem that we should be concerned about. All across the world, people are facing a wealth of new and challenging environmental problems every day. Some of them are small and only affect a few ecosystems, but others are drastically changing the landscape of what we already know.</p>

			<h3>Planting Trees Organization</h3>
			<p>Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals.Planting a billion trees can help save the Earth from climate change and biodiversity loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity. A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together.</p>

			<h3>Cleaning Beach Organization</h3>
			<p>Earth’s oceans and beaches are a mess, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fortunately, there are several coalitions of activists and volunteers who are looking to clean up these valuable marine habitats. Many ocean and beach cleanup organizations are looking for volunteers or donations to help them in their good work, and we’ve compiled some of them here for those who wish to lend a hand in some way. Keep reading to find out how you can help!/p>

			<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle Organization</h3>
			<p>SThere are many ways to manage waste in our communities but the most preferred one is waste reduction through reduce, reuse, and recycle (3Rs). Applying the 3Rs yield many environmental benefits including reduction/prevention of greenhouse gas, pollution reduction, conservation of resources, energy saving, reduction in the demand for waste treatment and landfill space. This page of the website will provide information on the 3Rs and useful links to more educational materials. </p>
