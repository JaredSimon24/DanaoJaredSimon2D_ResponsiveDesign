			 <h4>Sustainability</h4>
			<p>
               The current economic system is driven by the lie that endless growth is both good and sustainable. And it is the corporations (and often governments) that are benefiting the most from this consumer culture.
               This is why we’re challenging the practices and business models that drive this culture of consumption, through individual actions and sustained pressure on corporations and key decision makers to put us on a sustainable path before it’s too late.</p>

               <h4>Our Vision</h4>
               <p>We are aiming for a transformation of how we see the world and ourselves in it. We want to support a shift from consumption to sharing, from competition to collaboration. We need a world where oceans and forests are protected and are allowed to flourish. We need a new story to emerge, one that places the entire Earth’s ability to thrive above the greed of a few.</p>




               <h4>Society</h4>
               <p>For us to transform the world, we need to break down the oppressive systems that hinder us from ensuring a green and peaceful future for all. We have to defend our democracy and resist tyranny, because there cannot be environmental justice without social justice.</p>

               <h4>Our Vision</h4>
               <p>We envision a Philippines where the people are not afraid. Where every Filipino’s basic needs are met, and the government protects the interests and safety of the people, instead of catering to the greed of a few.</p>

			<h3>Planting Trees Organization</h3>
			<p>Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals.Planting a billion trees can help save the Earth from climate change and biodiversity loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity. A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together.</p>

			<h3>Cleaning Beach Organization</h3>
			<p>Earth’s oceans and beaches are a mess, and we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fortunately, there are several coalitions of activists and volunteers who are looking to clean up these valuable marine habitats. Many ocean and beach cleanup organizations are looking for volunteers or donations to help them in their good work, and we’ve compiled some of them here for those who wish to lend a hand in some way. Keep reading to find out how you can help!</p>

			<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle Organization</h3>
			<p>SThere are many ways to manage waste in our communities but the most preferred one is waste reduction through reduce, reuse, and recycle (3Rs). Applying the 3Rs yield many environmental benefits including reduction/prevention of greenhouse gas, pollution reduction, conservation of resources, energy saving, reduction in the demand for waste treatment and landfill space. This page of the website will provide information on the 3Rs and useful links to more educational materials. </p>

			<h3>Solid-Waste Management</h3>
			<p>Solid-waste management, the collecting, treating, and disposing of solid material that is discarded because it has served its purpose or is no longer useful. Improper disposal of municipal solid waste can create unsanitary conditions, and these conditions in turn can lead to pollution of the environment and to outbreaks of vector-borne disease—that is, diseases spread by rodents and insects.</p>

			<h3>OCEAN PLASTIC POLLUTION</h3>
			<p>The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization developing and scaling technologies to rid the oceans of plastic. To achieve this objective, we have to work on a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean and doesn’t go away by itself. This goal means we plan to put ourselves out of business – once we have completed this project, our work is done.</p>

			<h3>Planting Sorrounding</h3>
			<p>Since the pandemic broke out, the youth are encourageed to plant five trees on their sorrounding places. Five trees per one individual is already a great help to earth and its biodicerity.</p>
